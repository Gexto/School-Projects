            HBO Max was founded in early 2020; even though HBO Max is relatively
            new, HBO has been around since the 1970s. HBO has been creating
            original series like The Sopranos, True Blood, The Wire, and Game of
             Thrones. Warner Media owned a  streaming service called HBO Go or
             HBO Now. It was nothing compared to Netflix or Hulu at the time,
             the service had very limited content to satisfy a broad population.
             In 2020 the corporation Warner Media announced they were creating
             their streaming service, Warner Media took what they already owned
             (HBO Go) and rebranded it, they needed to make it different so they
             included all of Warner Media's properties, like the DC franchise,
             IT movies, and well-known classics like Alien. Around fall 2020,
             in a desperate effort, they announced all of their theatrical
             movies will go straight to their streaming service until 2022, as a
             long-term investment to get more subscribers, but they would do
             this at a cost and lose money from the box office side of the
             business. HBO Max would have a larger subscriber count if they were
             not domesticated, it is unclear if HBO Max will expand globally.

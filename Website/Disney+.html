            Disney+ is considered another response to The streaming wars, it is
            arguably the second-largest streaming service in 2021 and will reach
             more than half of Netflixâ€™s subscriber count in a few years. Disney+
             currently is much cheaper than Netflix, they are $8.00 a month and
             will increase their price every year. A question often asked is
             what sets Disney+ from other services, I would say the fact that
             they have a library of nostalgic animated movies/series that other
             services do not have. Their content consists of globally known
             brands such as Marvel, Star Wars, Pixar, and all of the Disney
             properties, something other services cannot compete on. Disney+
             will also come out with their own original content like
             The Mandalorian, Wandavision, and recently The Falcon and
             Winter Soldier, and will go on full force in the coming years.
             Unlike other services, Disney offers a packaged deal of Hulu,
             ESPN+, and Disney+ for the same price as Netflix.
